# RightWalk – Citizen AI Platform

RightWalk builds **AI-powered public infrastructure** that helps citizens access complex government services through simple, trusted conversational interfaces.

Our flagship implementation focuses on **India’s apprenticeship ecosystem (NAPS)**, enabling young people to discover opportunities, receive guidance, and complete required workflows entirely through WhatsApp — in their own language and at their own pace.

## This Repository

This repository contains two complementary documents that together describe the system:

### 1. [Citizen AI](citizen_ai.md)

A **vision-first, long-horizon document** that captures:
- the product and policy journey,
- field learnings and pivots,
- design principles rooted in equity and accessibility,
- and the long-term roadmap toward Digital Public Good (DPG) positioning.

Citizen AI answers **why** the system exists and **where** it is headed.

---

### 2. [System Architecture](architecture.md)

A **reality-first, technical document** that describes:
- the system as it is deployed today,
- near-term architectural evolution,
- operational boundaries and guarantees,
- and engineering decisions grounded in field constraints.

The architecture document answers **what is running now** and **how it is built**.

## How to Read This

- **Start with this file** for context.
- Read **Citizen AI** to understand intent, philosophy, and long-term direction.
- Read **System Architecture** to understand implementation, control boundaries, and operational design.

Together, these documents describe not just a system, but an approach to building **responsible, auditable, and scalable AI for public service delivery**.
